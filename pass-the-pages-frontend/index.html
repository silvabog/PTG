    <h2> What is Pass The Pages?</h2>
    <p>
      This is a book donation website for students to donate books they don’t use anymore. Many students struggle with the high costs of textbooks, while others have old books they no longer need. 
      This platform provides a peer-to-peer exchange system that connects students within the same campus or nearby locations, allowing them to reduce waste, save money, and promote a circular economy for academic materials. 
      There is a gratitude tip option, but it’s not mandatory to do.
